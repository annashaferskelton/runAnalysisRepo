The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

RATIONALE FOR DESCRIPTIVE VARIABLE NAMES

- General info: - While it is ambiguous whether we are required to rename the column names, according to the answer to this post:
https://class.coursera.org/getdata-015/forum/thread?thread_id=26#post-970 
it looks like it would make the dataset tidier.
- From this post: 
https://class.coursera.org/getdata-015/forum/thread?thread_id=26#post-48
Explanation of what a descriptive name is: "Descriptive variable names means names based on the action the variable is recording, for example the Jerk of the body on the z axis of the phone. In general, the more 
descriptive is going to be the better.
- It is important to note that we are not required to use a name that long, we are just required to * base * our names on names with that amount of info.
- see code book for more detailed info, but:
- THE NAMES ARE DESCRIPTIVE BECAUSE I'VE BROKEN OUT OBSCURE PARTS OF THE ORIGINAL NAMES LIKE "f" AND "t" AND CHANGED THEM INTO ENGLISH WORDS OR MORE DESCRIPTIVE ABBREVIATIONS.
- "accelerometer/gyroscope" refers to where a given variable originated: an accelerometer or a gyroscipe(this corresponds to the "Acc" or "Gyro" in the original names.)
- the "acc" in many variable names just refers to the fact that these data are acceleration data and DOES NOT correspond to the "acc" in the original names or imply that the data were recorded with an accelerometer.
- Body/Grav refers to whether the acceleration measured is from the body or from gravity
- "frequencyDomain" or "timeDomain" corresponds to the "f" or "t" in the original data.


INDIVIDUAL VARIABLES:
* all information about units and data collection can be found in the information above about the original dataset.* 

* also note that all variables here are aggregated means of their respective measurement types. That means that for each measurement variable described below, the data are means of many measurements for a given subject and activity type.*
